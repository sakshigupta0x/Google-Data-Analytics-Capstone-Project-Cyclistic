In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share oering. Since then, the program has grown to a feet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago.
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing tobroad consumer segments.


## Business Objective
The company wants to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members and for this it needs to find out how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes dierently.

## Tools
This project uses R for Data Cleaning, Data Transformation and Data Visualisation

## Conclusion
To encourage more people to become a member, the Cyclists can adopt some of the following strategies:
* Launch a point based reward system based on distance traveled for members.
* Casual riders use the services more on weekend for recreational and leisure activities so marketing schemes should be launched around areas like cafes, parks, community centres and theatres and offer group discounts. 
* Increasing marketing activities in the top popular stations along with promotional offers.
* Devise a promotional scheme for winter months to help pickup low ridership during these months.
* Offering Discounted campaigns during weekdays to encourage more casual riders to use the service during the week
